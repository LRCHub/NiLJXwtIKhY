[00:02.79] Dang
[00:04.93] I ain't ever puttin' WD-40 on this front porch chain
[00:10.72] I can't, but I can almost hear that paycheck droppin' in the bank
[00:18.97] I don't know what's gonna happen tonight
[00:21.99] But there's a good chance it's gonna sound like
[00:45.49] 
[00:25.20] Boots on the back porch stompin' on the two-four little bit of long neck clank
[00:30.81] Tires on the chert rock, Bubba Shot the jukebox bendin' them guitar strings
[00:36.62] Cold can packin' and some old boys crackin' on whatever's in the cooler light
[00:43.62] Sure sounds like my kinda Saturday night
[01:03.62] 
[01:02.10] Hot damn
[01:05.40] You oughta hear a tail gate droppin' on an old Dodge Ram
[01:10.36] Or all my rowdy friends
[01:13.76] Standin' 'round a bonfire, drinkin' singin' "Pickup Man"
[01:19.34] Howlin' like some Bluetick hounds
[01:22.31] Man, I almost hear it now
[01:34.81] 
[01:25.37] Boots on the back porch stompin' on the two-four little bit of long neck clank
[01:30.71] Tires on the chert rock, Bubba Shot the jukebox bendin' them guitar strings
[01:36.52] Cold can packin' and some old boys crackin' on whatever's in the cooler light
[01:43.04] Sure sounds like my kinda Saturday night
[02:03.04] 
[02:02.64] Boots on the back porch stompin' on the two-four little bit of long neck clank
[02:07.91] Tires on the chert rock, Bubba Shot the jukebox bendin' them guitar strings
[02:13.85] Cold can packin' and some old boys crackin' on whatever's in the cooler light
[02:20.68] Sure sounds like my kinda Saturday night
[02:23.73] Sounds like my kinda Saturday night
[02:26.16] Sounds like my kinda Saturday night
